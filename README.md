# Overview

The paper is the output of the undergraduate thesis by Ida Ayu Saskara
Tranggana Suari (first author; Gede Primahadi Wijaya Rajeg \[second
author\]; I Nengah Sudipa \[third author\]), exploring
grammatical/morphological and semantic profiles of ANGRY/ANGER and
MAD(DEN) based on data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English
(COCA). The thesis is one of the outcome from two of the students taking
the English Lexicology and Lexicography course taught by Gede Primahadi
Wijaya Rajeg, who also introduced COCA to the students. The other
related undergraduate-student thesis-and-article project is by I Gede
Semara Dharma Putra
([repository](https://github.com/gederajeg/verb-noun-association)), who
combined corpus-based data from COCA and experimental data to explore
divergence/convergence in the verb-noun association.
